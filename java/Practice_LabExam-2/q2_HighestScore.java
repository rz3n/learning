 * q2_HighestScore
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of 
 * students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally 
 * displays the name of the student with the highest score. 
 * Use the next() method in the Scanner class to read a name, 
 * rather than using the nextLine() method. Assume that the 
 * number of students is at least 1.
